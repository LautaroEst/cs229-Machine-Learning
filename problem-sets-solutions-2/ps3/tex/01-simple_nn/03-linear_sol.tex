\begin{answer}
    This is impossible. Note in this case
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        &h = (w^{[1]})^T x\\
        &o = \text{step}((w^{[2]})^T h) = \text{step}((w^{[2]}w^{[1]})^T x)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    And clearly the decision boundary will be a single line, which cannot separate the two classes.
