\begin{answer}
    When a regularization $\lambda \|\theta\|$ is added, the equation in (b) becomes
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^m y^{(i)} = \sum_{i=1}^m h_\theta(x^{(i)}) + 2\lambda \theta_0
    $$
    where $\theta_0$ is the parameter for the intercept. In general, we will not penalize this term, and in this case regularization will have no effect.
