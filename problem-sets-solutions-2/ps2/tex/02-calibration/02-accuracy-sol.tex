\begin{answer}
    Both the answer are no. Suppose 50\% of the data is positive, then a model which always outputs $0.5$ will also be perfectly calibrated. On the other hand, a model that outputs $0.75$ for positive examples and $0.25$ for negative examples will have perfect accuracy, but is not perfectly-calibrated.
\end{answer}
